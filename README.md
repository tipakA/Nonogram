# Nonogram

### ~~Not yet working~~ nonogram ~~solver~~ displayer.

Eventually, this project will become a working solver. No clue if i will make it linked with a website, but that's too far ahead.

In the current state, all it can do is nicely display a nonogram board in console, in a way you would see in any nonogram game:
